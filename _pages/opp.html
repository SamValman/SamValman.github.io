<h1> Oppertunities taken whilst studying under the Geospatial Systems CDT</h1>

<p>This CDT has many opportunites to work with industry, attend seminars and share knowledge. Under this tab I will keep a record of some of these opportunities.</p>

<h2>MRes Group Project: Archeological degradation</h2>

<p>Due to the restraints of COVID and geography, the entire group project was carried out online, with the four team members in Nottingham, Newcastle, Ireland and Italy. The Vindolanda trust commissioned the groups to monitor and measure the degradation and risk to the roman fort of Magna on Hadrians wall. This was done via a soil erosion model, drainage analysis, satellite vegetation change analysis and a web page. Judged the most effective group our project was put forwards for publication found here <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/10/9/575">Integration and Analysis of Multi-Modal Geospatial Secondary Data to Inform Management of at-Risk Archaeological Sites</a> and was also made the cover image of this journal article. </p>

<h2>Challenge week 2021</h2>

<p>This challenge week involved group work within a vertically and horizontally mixed set of CDT student Cohorts. The 5 day challenge took place in Newcastle and involved a 4 "hack-a-thon" style work process which was then presented to the CDT and industry partners at the annual assembly on the Friday. </p>
<p>This years challenge was to use geospatial skills to predict the most profitable and desirable places to place electric car chargers. This was done for the ZeroCarbonFuture group and Kinewell energy.</p>
<p>
    Our method created heat maps of current chargers and used correlation and hotspot anayses to suggest which factors make Electric Car chargers the most used. We also noted that there was a lack of data on what the future customer will demand if all drivers have to use electric vehicles. To solve this issue we proposed a mapping system where drivers highlight areas they would like chargers. A pilot example site was created: <a href="http://www.wherewouldyoucharge.co.uk/">http://www.wherewouldyoucharge.co.uk/</a>.
